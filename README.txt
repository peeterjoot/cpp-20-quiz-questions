I'd initially populated this repo with programming questions from a job interview test, as I wanted to followup up for myself on those questions, having messed them up in the test.

I figured that nobody but me would ever look at the repo, but I got a DMCA takedown notice from the test company.

This repo now omits those questions and my attempted solutions.
